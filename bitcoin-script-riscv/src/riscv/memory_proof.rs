//! Adjudicating one node of a published memory multiproof.
//!
//! Under [`MemoryModel::Merkle`](bitvmx_cpu_definitions::memory_tree::MemoryModel)
//! a read is justified by a Merkle path rather than by a `last_step`
//! pointer, and the endgame has to decide whether that path is good.
//!
//! It does not check the whole path on chain.  A multiproof over the four
//! words one instruction touches carries 89 siblings at the deployed depth,
//! and recomputing all of it in Script would be absurd.  Instead the prover
//! publishes the proof *and the working it drives* -- every node the
//! verifier computes on the way to the root -- and only if a challenger
//! says one of those nodes is wrong is a single node adjudicated.  That is
//! the locally-refutable shape: the claim is published, and one check over
//! a few words of a canonical verification trace decides it.
//!
//! So the on-chain cost of the memory argument is one of these scripts,
//! paid only when a path is actually disputed.  Each is a naysayer: it
//! *succeeds* when the published working is wrong, exactly as
//! `trace_hash_challenge` succeeds when a claimed state hash is wrong.
//!
//! # Why the node hash is blake3
//!
//! Bitcoin has no `OP_CAT`, so a Merkle path cannot be checked with the
//! native `OP_SHA256`: there is no way to build a parent's preimage from
//! two children on the stack.  The hash has to be implemented in Script
//! over nibbles, as BitVMX already does for its state hash, and then the
//! binding constraint is not weight but the thousand-element stack limit.
//!
//! Measured in this crate's interpreter:
//!
//! | hash over 40 bytes | script | peak stack |
//! |--------------------|-------:|-----------:|
//! | SHA-256            | 213,758 B | **979** |
//! | blake3 -> 20 bytes |  69,872 B | **659** |
//!
//! SHA-256 peaks at 979 *before* anything else is on the stack.  A node
//! check also has to hold the claimed parent, forty nibbles, which puts it
//! at 1,019 and over the limit -- the script aborts with `StackSize` rather
//! than deciding anything.  blake3 leaves 341 elements spare, is a third of
//! the size, and emits twenty bytes natively instead of thirty-two that
//! must then be truncated.  It is also the hash BitVMX already computes in
//! Script, so the two share one set of lookup tables.
//!
//! [`SHA256_NODE_PEAK_STACK`] records the measurement that forces this.
//!
//! # Unreconciled: the Rust tree still hashes with SHA-256
//!
//! `bitvmx_cpu_definitions::memory_tree` builds the tree with SHA-256,
//! following the paper's Definition 8.1, and this module checks it with
//! blake3.  **They do not agree, and the endgame cannot work until one of
//! them moves.**  The measurement above says which way: SHA-256 cannot be
//! checked on chain at all, so the tree's hash is the thing that has to
//! change.  Nothing depends on the tree's hash except the tree itself --
//! the publication commitment keeps SHA-256, because Bitcoin's own
//! signature hash is SHA-256 and that is a different object.
//!
//! `the_rust_tree_and_this_script_do_not_yet_agree` pins the gap so that
//! it cannot be forgotten, and will start failing the moment it closes.
